# How to install Anaconda
## Linux or MacOS

1. In your browser, download the [Anaconda installer for Ubuntu](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#linux) or [Anaconda installer for macOS](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#macos).

2. Open the terminal and enter the following to install Anaconda for Python 3.7:

```
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

> **NOTE:** If you did not download to your Downloads directory, replace `~/Downloads/` with the path to the file you downloaded.

3. The installer prompts “In order to continue the installation process, please review the license agreement.” Click Enter to view license terms.

4. Scroll to the bottom of the license terms and enter “Yes” to agree.

5. The installer prompts you to click Enter to accept the default install location, CTRL+C to cancel the installation, or specify an alternate installation directory. If you accept the default install location, the installer displays `PREFIX=/home/<user>/anaconda<2 or 3>` and continues the installation. It may take a few minutes to complete.

6. The installer prompts “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?” We recommend “yes”.

7. The installer finishes and displays `Thank you for installing Anaconda<2 or 3>!`

## Windows

1. [Download the Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows).

2. Double click the installer to launch.

3. Click next.

4. Read the licensing terms and click “I Agree”.

5. Select an install for “Just Me” unless you’re installing for all users (which requires Windows Administrator privileges) and click Next.

6. Select a destination folder to install Anaconda and click the Next button.

7. Choose whether to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. We recommend not adding Anaconda to the PATH environment variable, since this can interfere with other software. Instead, use Anaconda software by opening Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu.

8. Choose whether to register Anaconda as your default Python. Unless you plan on installing and running multiple versions of Anaconda or multiple versions of Python, accept the default and leave this box checked.

9. Click the Install button. If you want to watch the packages Anaconda is installing, click Show Details.

10. Click the "Next" button.

11. **Optional:** To install PyCharm for Anaconda, click on the link that is visible on the window. Or to install Anaconda without PyCharm, click the "Next" button.

12. After a successful installation you will see the “Thanks for installing Anaconda”.

13. If you wish to read more about Anaconda Cloud and how to get started with Anaconda, check the boxes “Learn more about Anaconda Cloud” and “Learn how to get started with Anaconda”. Click the "Finish" button.
