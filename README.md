# Mechanical-Tracking-Eye
Track a specifc person in the camera motion range by their face characteristics, if its lost, an object tracking mechanism is activated with the same coordinates as the last known face position. Built upon "**ageitgey**" *face_recognition* neural network.

## Introduction
    The project Sentry eye is a IEEE RAS Unesp Bauru's proposal to develop a camera that is capable of moving in all cartesian axis while searching a previous registered person, named as "target". The user is requested to take a photo with the camera and will be registered in doing so, then he will be asked to chose between three values of velocity, small, medium or fast, that will change the softness of the camera's movement. After that, delimiters for the face position will be created and will act as a response for the target getting to the sides, farther or closer to the camera's visual range. If it identifies the face, the camera will start to follow the target by utilizing the delimiters response, if it doesnt find it, it will start to move left and right in a sentry iddle mode.

    The project's base ideia came from the haunted paintings present in animated shows, where it follows the protagonists when they walk nearby, and from the sentry turrets present in the game Portal 2. although the idea originally came from a comic perspective it was possible to see real life aplication, like permiting the camera to adjust the image of a professor doing lecture, removing the need for a operator always moving and positioning the best view angle.  

    We belive that the project will help in disseminate technological interest and knowledge within the city we live in and even outside, besides helping anyone that finds this and wants to use it in any research activity.
